# Scripts Collection

A random collections of scripts I'm writing to get some things done. Not really intended to be shared, just hosted here for my peace of mind... so use at your own risk.

### copy-tagged-files

Looks inside the <source_directory> and all subdirectories for files of accepted
extensions that have a certain <tag> and copies them to the <destination_directory>. Tested on OSX only.

### batch-image-resize

Goes through all the images in a given directory, crops them to a specified aspect ratio and scales them (down only) for all the resolutions needed.
